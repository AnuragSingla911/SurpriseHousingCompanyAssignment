## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.


## Conclusions
- We will go with Lasso regression model
- Optimal alpha value of Lasso is 500
- Top 5 predictors variables for housing prices are :Ground Living Area, Finish Very good, Year in which property is built, Finish of Type 1, Total Basement Area
